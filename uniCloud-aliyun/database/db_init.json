Today I want to share my experience of stepping out of the emotional valley, hoping to give some strength to those who are in困境 (difficult situations).\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>I was once shrouded in anxiety and depression, and life was completely dark. But I didn't give up and gradually explored my own healing methods.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>I started recording my daily emotional changes and found that many negative emotions originated from excessive worry about the future. So I tried to live in the present and focus on small things at hand, such as carefully savoring every bite of food and feeling the warmth of the sun on my face. Gradually, my mindset began to change.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>At the same time, I also released pressure through exercise. Running and yoga became indispensable parts of my life. Every time I sweated profusely, I felt much more relaxed physically and mentally.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>Now I can manage my emotions better, and life is full of hope. I hope my sharing can help you.\n",

Today, I'll share how I diffuse anger.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>Anger is actually a normal emotion, but if not handled properly, it can hurt ourselves and those around us.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>When anger surges up, I first give myself 10 seconds to calm down and silently count in my heart to let the impulsive emotion subside slightly. After that, I try to put myself in the other person's shoes and think about why they did that. Maybe I can understand their position, and the anger will gradually decrease.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>I also write down my angry emotions to vent through words. After writing, I find that I feel much more comfortable and can view the problem more rationally.\n<div class='cl-preview-section'>I hope these methods can help everyone better control their emotions.\n",
