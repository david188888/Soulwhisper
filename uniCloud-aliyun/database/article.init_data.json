Today I share my experience of diffusing anger, hoping to help those struggling with emotional control. Once dominated by anger, I often acted impulsively and regretted later, but I learned to reconcile with this emotion and found my own way to calm down. Anger is actually a normal emotion, but if not handled properly, it can hurt ourselves and those around us. When anger surges up, I first give myself 10 seconds to calm down and silently count in my heart to let the impulsive emotion subside slightly; this 'mental buffer' allows impulsive thoughts to fade, letting reason regain control. After that, I try to put myself in the other person's shoes and ask: 'Why might they have acted this way?' Understanding others' motivations often dissolves anger, replacing it with tolerance. I also write down my angry emotions to vent through words—the act of transcription transforms chaos into clarity, helping me view problems objectively. I hope these methods can help everyone better control their emotions. Now, anger no longer dictates my actions. Remember: <i>Emotions are waves—we don't need to drown in them.</i></p></div>",

Today I want to talk about the emotion of loneliness, which is not scary at all but hides a growth code. On the journey of life, we will always feel lonely at times, yet it is these lonely moments that offer us the opportunity to understand ourselves deeply. I used to be afraid of loneliness, always feeling desolate when alone, but later I learned to enjoy solitary times—reading books, learning new skills, and reflecting on life during solitude. Gradually, I found myself becoming more independent and confident. Loneliness is like an inner practice, teaching us to get along with ourselves and discover our potential; when we stop running away from loneliness, we can harvest growth and strength from it. I hope everyone can understand the meaning behind loneliness and shine their own light in moments of solitude.</p></div>",

Music can resonate with my emotions whether I’m happy or sad: when I’m in a low mood, a soothing piano piece can calm me down, as if someone is gently comforting me; when I’m full of energy, passionate rock music can ignite my enthusiasm and make me full of motivation. I also try to play musical instruments myself—In the process of creating music, I express my inner emotions through notes, a wonderful feeling like finding an outlet for emotions. I hope everyone can also find their own musical medicine to heal emotions and feel the beauty of life.</p></div>",
