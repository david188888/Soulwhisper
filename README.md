# 1. Core ideas
In the current fast-paced, high-pressure work and study environment, young people who struggle alone or are introverted and socially awkward need private emotional vent channels and spiritual comfort. This software is based on voice recording diary, AI quantitative emotion analysis, coupled with the anonymous sharing and exchange of stories between each other's "emotional bottle" community, and the AI healing partner function with psychological expertise, to create a private emotional outlet for users, provide spiritual healing services, and protect the mental health of young people.

**Keywords** : Voice diary, emotional visualization, emotional drift bottle, AI spiritual healing.

# 2. User demand analysis
### 1. User groups ** *
Young people aged 18-35 who struggle alone, are introverted, or face greater academic and work pressure
### 2. **User pain points**
1. Inefficient recording method aggravates emotional backlog ** : Traditional typing record is time-consuming and laborious, users lack patience, leading to long-term negative emotions backlog, and even lead to anxiety or depression, in need of a more convenient and efficient recording method.
2. Fuzzy emotional cognition increases the risk of losing control ** : Under heavy pressure, users find it difficult to pay attention to their emotional state, and are easy to fall into emotional fluctuations or lose control. A tool that can quantify and regularly analyze emotions is needed to help real-time attention and adjustment of emotions.
3. The isolation of the lack of scientific guidance when the mood is low ** : when the mood is low, users are deterred by the high cost of traditional psychological counseling, which may develop into serious psychological problems in the long run, and need low-cost, highly private and instantly available psychological counseling channels.
4. **Difficult to resonate emotional isolation** : users are difficult to get understanding and comfort from people around them, and need a highly anonymous emotional connection platform that can share and communicate with similar experiences.
### 3. What can users benefit from our platform?
1. **Efficient emotional catharsis** : Through the intelligent voice diary function, users can record and release emotions in the most convenient way to avoid the psychological burden caused by long-term backlog.
2. **Clear emotional cognition** : Emotional data analysis helps users quantify their emotional state, provides visual emotional reports, and allows users to understand their emotional changes more clearly and adjust their mentality in time.
3. **Scientific Psychological counseling** : AI Spiritual Healing partners provide instant and professional emotional guidance to help users get scientific support when they are at a low point and reduce the risk of psychological problems.
4. **Emotional resonance and connection** : Anonymous community "Emotional drift bottle" allows users to share and communicate with similar experiences, gain understanding and comfort, relieve loneliness, and enhance emotional belonging.
